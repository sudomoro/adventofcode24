# Project Name: Generic Analysis Framework

## Objective
Provide a structured and modular framework to analyze datasets by preparing data, performing intermediate calculations, and generating results.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Purpose**: Load and clean data for analysis.
- **Steps**: 
  - Load raw data from a source (e.g., file, database).
  - Perform cleaning, filtering, and transformation.
  - Structure the data into a usable format.

### 2. Adding Analysis Columns
- **Purpose**: Create intermediate calculations to enrich the dataset for further insights.
- **Examples**:
  - Calculate differences or trends in sequences.
  - Apply rolling averages or other aggregations.
  - Derive flags or status columns based on conditions.

### 3. Calculating Results
- **Purpose**: Compute summary metrics, validations, or classifications based on the analysis columns.
- **Examples**:
  - Aggregate metrics like averages, maximums, or counts.
  - Generate classifications (e.g., "safe" or "unsafe").
  - Return results as a report or data structure.

## Key Features
- **Modularity**: Separate methods for each stage of the analysis process.
- **Customizability**: Extend the framework for specific analysis tasks by subclassing.
- **Scalability**: Handles datasets of varying sizes efficiently.

## Usage
1. **Initialize**: Provide a data source (e.g., file path) to the class.
2. **Analyze**: Use the `analyze` method to run the workflow.
3. **Retrieve Results**: Access the calculated results for insights or further use.

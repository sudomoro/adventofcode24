# Day Two: Sequence Safety Analysis

## Objective
Analyze sequences of levels in reactor reports to determine whether they are "safe" based on monotonicity and bounded differences.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Monotonicity
- **Definition**: A safe sequence must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
- **Purpose**: Ensures predictable trends in the sequence.

### 2. Bounded Differences
- **Definition**: Consecutive levels in the sequence must differ by a value between 1 and 3 (inclusive).
- **Purpose**: Prevents abrupt spikes or drops in the sequence, maintaining stability.

## Applications
- **Monitoring System Stability**: Ensures smooth operation in processes like nuclear reactors or other systems.
- **Sequential Data Validation**: Detects anomalies or unsafe patterns in ordered data.

## Takeaways
- Monotonicity ensures **predictable trends**.
- Bounded differences maintain **gradual and stable changes**.
- Combining these rules ensures **safety and stability**.
